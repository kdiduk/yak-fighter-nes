Actual:
- save/restore registers in NMI: stack vs memory, compare speed/size
- remove "neslib" and "famitone" from the project
- use 8x16 sprites
- aircraft propeller animation

Archive:
- remove "famitone2.s" and it's usages (no sounds in the future releases)
- "neslib.s": compile separalely from startup.s, and link (not include)
